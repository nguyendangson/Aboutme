# üßê About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate graduated in May 2024 in Mathematics at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. I also earned a Master's degree in Optimization and Statistics at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.



Currently, I am looking for jobs e.g. Data Science, Statistician, Quantitative Analysis/Research, Machine Learning Engineering, and Computational Science

# ‚Ñº Research
I am interested in both Math and Computer Science. My research focuses on Optimization/Probability/Statistics problems and their applications involving Geometry and Graph theory such as Matrix Scaling, Sampling on Convex Body, Hight-dimension Convex Geometry,...
